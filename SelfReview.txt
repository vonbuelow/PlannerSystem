What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?

This may not be a wish but the different ideas of a user and schedule for us were implemented
differently than how we approached it. The way we set up a user coupled the schedule with a name.
Where our provider has a user and then a schedule implementation. Which made it difficult to think
of how to approach making adapters. Specifically create/add user in the model adapter. It is a back
and forth of the schedule and user adapter.

Wish we were less liberal in what we allowed the client to do as far as adding or removing invitees.
In the future not allowing the client to add users that are already invited.

Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you,
or the updates you had to make for your customers?

One overall lesson is the importance of MODULARITY having an interface from the jump is a great way
to design especially when considering adapters since interfaces are the glue between a patch-worked
program. This came from both the code given to us when requesting additional interfaces and
interfaces such as Time and Location which we overlooked to make modular.

What was your experience like with your providers?

Our providers did amazing with communication and delivering interfaces within a reasonable time.
Whenever we had a question they did a good job of explaining their implementation in simple way.
