What do you wish you had done differently in your design/implementation?

Did you learn any lessons from the code given to you,
or the updates you had to make for your customers?

One overall lesson is the importance of MODULARITY having an interface from the jump is a great way
to design especially when considering adapters since interfaces are the glue between a patch-worked
program. This came from both the code given to us when requesting additional interfaces and
interfaces such as Time and Location which we overlooked to make modular.

What was your experience like with your providers?

Our providers did amazing with communication and delivering interfaces within a reasonable time.
Whenever we had a question they did a good job of explaining their implementation in simple way.
