Overview:
What problem is this codebase trying to solve?
What high-level assumptions are made in the codebase, either about the background knowledge needed,
about what forms of extensibility are envisioned or are out of scope, or about prerequisites for
using this code?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quick start: give a short snippet of code showing how a user might get started using this codebase.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key components: Explain the highest-level components in your system, and what they do.
It is trite and useless to merely say “The model represents the data in my system.
The view represents the rendering of my system. ...”
This is a waste of your time and the reader’s time.
Describe which components “drive” the control-flow of your system, and which ones “are driven”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Key subcomponents: Within each component, give an overview of the main nouns in your system,
and why they exist and what they are used for.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Source organization: Either explain for each component where to find it in your codebase,
or explain for each directory in your codebase what components it provides.
Either way, supply the reader with a “map” to your codebase, so they can navigate around.
