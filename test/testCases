- an event should only span a MAX of one week
    - ex. wed 4pm to wed 3:59pm (valid), 4pm to 4pm (invalid)
    - if invalid (too long), then error in model class, message to user to adjust (controller)
- invalid start days
    - ex. valid examples only?
    - METHOD: total amount of hours between start and end dates?
    - start and end day are EXACTLY ONE WEEK 24*7 = testing methods return amt.
    - an event with a start day that is NOT CAPITALIZED
    - an event with a an invalid time (a day not in the enum)
    - online elements spelled without being exactly "true" or "false" -> error out
    - user element with no uid tags -> error out

- two events overlapping
    - one ends at 4pm, other starts at 3pm same day --> ?????????? throw exception or do nothing (show message)

- individual schedules (each person has exactly one)
    - test when user has two schedules given (exception???)
    - one event at any given time for an individual
        - EXCEPTION being the end time of an event == the start time of another event
    - someone with the same name but different schedules

- if modifying an event, change appears on all invitees' schedules
    - if user removes (not host), remove only from their schedule
        - if host, remove from all invitees' and their schedules

- a user does not have to exist (it does nothing)
    - once user exists, add to list of invitees for appropriate events (keep list of doesn't exist users)
    - if schedule initially given to user has event overlapping with already existing event, don't schedule the given event

- Invariant??: time can only be btw 0000 and 2359 (constructor checks this)
