Functionality with adapters:
    EventAdapter - implementing their event representation and being able to go from (an adapter of
                   our representation to their event interface functionality.
    ModelAdapter - implementing their system interface (model) working with an abstract adapter
                   that simplified many reoccurring translations between types. Taking in our model
                   as an adapter to then relay the same functionality of their model.
 ScheduleAdapter - implementing their schedule interface and user interface into one adapter. By
                   maintaining their interfaces functionality.
    ViewAdapter  - implementing our view to work with their view by taking their view in as a
                   delegate.

WHAT WORKS:
1. the types are all accounted for
2. the functionality of showing their view frame, without the lines or
