Code Review:

- How flexible are the interfaces you were given?
There intially were not that many interfaces when it came to parameter and subclass implementation.
That consisted of changing their code to implement the interfaces we requested as mentioned
below.

- How capable are the views?
!!!!!!!!!!

- How convenient was it to reuse their code?
It was less a matter of convenience and more so how could we adapt in a round about way to go from
one representation of a schedule to the other. Our first instance of this would be our providers
had a class representing a user, that user had a name and a schedule. Where our schedule impl.
had a name and list of events so keeping track of what is ours and their implementation.

- How cleanly written and well-documented was their code?

The code was well documented and written for the most part but when it came to adjusting to
the parameters that is where we requested additional documentation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you needed to request changes from them, what were they and why were they needed?

We requested interfaces for User, Event, and Schedule, since we did not have access
to the class implementations with the same sets of methods. In multiple interfaces
such as SystemInterface, there were methods with a User or Event parameter/return
type instead of an interface type, so we needed new interfaces to implement the
existing ones. Then adapting to their use of the java classes representing time and adjusting
to the new representation.

Write a short (3-4 paragraph) review of their code. Your review should have the
following sections: Design critique, implementation critique, documentation critique,
design/code limitations and suggestions on how to address them.

Be Nice!
